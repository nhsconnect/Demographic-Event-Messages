## Introduction ##

This Implementation Guide details the FHIR components required to fulfill the data item requirements of the following Demographics Update Event Messages, sharing updates made to demographic information held by the Personal Demographics Service (PDS): 

- [PDS Birth Notification](explore_pds_birth_notification.html)
- [PDS Change of Address](explore_pds_change_of_address.html)
- [PDS Change of GP](explore_pds_change_of_gp.html)
- [PDS Person Death](xplore_pds_person_death.html)

These communications will be published by the [Events Management Service](https://developer.nhs.uk/library/interoperability/events-management-service) (EMS).

## [INTEROPen](http://www.interopen.org) ##

FHIR components specified within this site have been developed by NHS Digital and use CareConnect profiles created in collaboration with the INTEROPen community. 

The INTEROPen vision is to create a library of nationally defined HL7® FHIR® resources and interaction patterns that implementers can adopt to simplify integration and interoperability within UK health and social care.

See [CareConnect FHIR Profiles](support_careconnect.html) for further clarification on the use of CareConnect FHIR profiles within this Implementation Guide.
